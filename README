Data::Struct

A Data::Struct is a data structure that can contain values
(attributes). The values of the attributes can be set at creation
time, and read and modified at run time. Attributes can be anything
that Perl can handle.

  use Data::Struct;
  # Define.
  struct Person => qw( name address city );
  # Create.
  my $p = struct Person => { name = "John Doe", city => "Paris" };
  # Use.
  $p->address = "Rue d'Eiffel 4993";

There's no checking done on types. You may want to use
L<Class::Struct> if you need type checking and inheritance.

This module implements structures without object features. It uses
lvalue accessors to allow value assignment. Lvalue accessors solve the
bikeshed problem of naming the accessors:

  attr / attr(1)
  set_attr / get_attr
  setAttr / getAttr
  SetAttr / GetAttr
  and so on.

Objects are much more powerful. Besides data, they can contain
behaviour (methods), support inheritance and encapsulation. Since this
module is dealing with data structuress and not Objects, I put it
under the Data:: hierarchy.

Please see L<Object::Tiny|Object::Tiny> cum suis for many similar
ideas.
